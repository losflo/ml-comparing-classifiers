    "A question I'd like to ask in the future is about the `duration` feature. I understand high correlation to no when the value is zero or an unreasonable length. If those unreasonable values are dropped is there a still a high correlation to 'yes' or 'no'? I also understand that you can't know the duration before a phone call, but if there is still a highly correlated value perhaps it could share insight on how long you should try to keep this customer on the line for the best chances. If we loop through some call duration values keeping everything else the same it could increase the chances of a 'yes'."
